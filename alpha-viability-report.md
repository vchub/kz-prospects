# Deep Search Report: Why "Project Alpha" (Magnum RMN) Hasn't Scaled

**Date:** January 31, 2026
**Subject:** Feasibility & Blockers Analysis for Independent Retail Media Network at Magnum Cash & Carry

## Executive Summary
The concept of transforming **Magnum Cash & Carry** into a Retail Media Network (RMN) is sound in theory but faces a massive structural blocker: **Kaspi.kz owns 90% of Magnum's E-commerce business.**
This joint venture effectively decapitates Magnum's ability to build an *independent* online ad platform, as its digital storefront is legally and technically controlled by the Kaspi ecosystem.

However, a **"Hybrid" Opportunity** remains: Magnum retains 100% control of its physical stores (200+ locations) and its loyalty program ("Magnum Club"). The path forward is not a standard E-commerce RMN (like Amazon Ads), but a **Physical RMN** that digitizes the in-store experience.

## 1. Structural Blockers (The "Why")

### A. The "Kaspi Capture" (Strategic Dead End)
*   **The Issue:** A standard RMN relies on monetizing web/app traffic.
*   **Finding:** Kaspi.kz invested $157M for a 90% stake in "Magnum E-commerce Kazakhstan."
*   **Impact:** Magnum does not own its online customer journey. Any "Sponsored Product" ads on the Magnum app would ultimately benefit Kaspi's P&L, not Magnum's independent ad unit. Kaspi forces traffic through its Super App, preventing Magnum from installing competing ad-tech (like Criteo/CitrusAd) on the web storefront.

### B. "Old School" Trade Marketing
*   **The Issue:** RMNs require programmatic, real-time bidding.
*   **Finding:** Magnum currently sells advertising via a manual sales team. They offer "slots" on turnstiles, banners, and shelf dividers.
*   **Impact:** This is "Rent," not "Media." Brands buy space for a month, not audiences for a moment. There is no dynamic pricing or attribution data, making it unattractive to performance marketers.

### C. Technical Fragmentation
*   **The Issue:** Data is siloed.
*   **Finding:** While they have "Smart Scales" (connected via Telegram bots), these are isolated IoT devices, not part of a unified ad server. The "Loyalty" data (Magnum Club) sits separate from the ad inventory.

## 2. The Viable Pivot: "Physical RMN"

Since the *Online* door is closed by Kaspi, Project Alpha must pivot to the *Offline* asset, which Kaspi does not control.

**The Opportunity:**
*   **Asset:** 200+ physical stores with massive foot traffic.
*   **Data:** "Magnum Club" loyalty history (what you bought offline).
*   **Execution:**
    1.  **Digitize the Store:** Replace paper shelf tags with **Digital Shelf Edge Screens** (Video Rails).
    2.  **Connect Loyalty Data:** Use the Magnum Club app to identify users at checkout (QR scan).
    3.  **The "Closed Loop":** Sell ads on the *Digital Shelves* and *Loyalty App* based on offline purchase history. (e.g., "User bought diapers last week -> Show baby food ad on their app today").

## 3. Competitive Landscape
*   **Kaspi:** Owns the digital transaction but lacks in-store influence.
*   **Technodom:** Focuses on electronics, not high-frequency FMCG.
*   **Global Vendors:** CitrusAd/Criteo have no major footprint yet, leaving the door open for a local integrator.

## 4. Verdict & Recommendation
*   **Is the original "Online RMN" viable?** **NO.** Kaspi owns the pipe.
*   **Is a "Physical/Loyalty RMN" viable?** **YES.**
*   **Recommendation:** Stop trying to build a web ad platform. Build a **"Digital Trade Marketing"** platform that programmatically sells in-store screens and loyalty app push notifications. This bypasses the Kaspi monopoly.
