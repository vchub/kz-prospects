# Final Investment Verdict: Kazakhstan AdTech & Retail Portfolio (2025-2026)

**TO:** Investment Committee / General Partners
**FROM:** Strategic Analysis Unit
**DATE:** January 31, 2026
**SUBJECT:** Selection of Top 5 Funding Candidates & Critical Risk Assessment

---

## 1. Executive Summary
Following a comprehensive audit of the Kazakhstan marketing ecosystem and a deep-dive into structural barriers, we have selected **five high-conviction projects**. Our investment thesis is built on "Middleware Sovereignty"—funding the infrastructure that allows challengers (Halyk, Magnum, Wildberries) to break the data monopoly of the Kaspi.kz "Walled Garden."

**General Allocation Strategy:** 65% into Infrastructure (Banks/OOH), 20% into Physical Retail Digitization, and 15% into High-Risk AI/Performance Software.

## 2. Selected Funding Candidates

### **Candidate 1: Project Epsilon (Halyk "Commerce Media")**
*   **Simple Explanation:** Using the bank's massive customer data to show highly relevant ads within the banking app (like showing a travel insurance ad to someone who just bought an airline ticket).
*   **Verdict:** 🟢 **STRONG BUY (Lead Investment)**
*   **Concept:** Building the programmatic ad-serving layer for Halyk Bank’s SuperApp to monetize its "Data Factory."
*   **Strategic Detail:** Due diligence confirms Halyk’s 49% acquisition of **Click** (Uzbekistan), creating a cross-border regional data repository of **32 million users**. Combined with Halyk’s reported 11% YoY growth in Monthly Active Users (MAU), this creates the only dataset in Central Asia capable of rivaling Kaspi’s scale.
*   **Execution Mechanism:**
    *   **Data Factory:** Leverage Halyk's internal "Data Factory" project to segment users based on anonymized credit card transaction history (e.g., "Frequent Flyer" or "Luxury Fashion Buyer").
    *   **Ad Delivery:** Serve targeted offers via the Halyk SuperApp interface and push notifications, effectively creating a "Banking-as-a-Service" media platform.
*   **Financial Assessment:**
    *   **Revenue Model:** Commission on ad spend (Media Margin). Banks typically see 1-2% lift in net revenue from mature ad networks.
    *   **ROI Potential:** 5x over 3 years.
    *   **Primary Risk:** Technical debt in legacy banking systems delaying API integration for real-time bidding.

### **Candidate 2: Project Delta (Citix "Programmatic OOH Exchange")**
*   **Simple Explanation:** Software that connects Kazakh billboards to the global internet, allowing international brands (like Nike or Coca-Cola) to buy ad space in Almaty as easily as they buy Facebook ads.
*   **Verdict:** 🟢 **STRONG BUY**
*   **Concept:** A Supply-Side Platform (SSP) connecting local digital boards (DOOH) to global ad exchanges via **OpenRTB** standards.
*   **Strategic Detail:** Confirmed expansion into **UAE (Sharjah)** and **Turkey** proves the technology is a high-margin export product. We recommend folding **Project "Mobility AdTech"** (specifically the "Shark" taxi roof screens) into this exchange to unify static and mobile outdoor inventory under one programmatic ID.
*   **Execution Mechanism:**
    *   **Global Pipe:** Build an adapter to connect Citix inventory directly to global Demand Side Platforms (DSPs) like **The Trade Desk** and **Google DV360**, allowing New York-based traders to bid on Almaty billboards in real-time.
    *   **Dynamic Triggers:** Enable bidding based on real-time environmental triggers (traffic jams, weather conditions) captured by Citix smartboards.
*   **Financial Assessment:**
    *   **Revenue Model:** 10-15% "Software Tax" (Take Rate) on all international and local programmatic transactions passing through the exchange.
    *   **ROI Potential:** 4x over 3 years.
    *   **Primary Risk:** Dependence on global DSPs for demand flow; local regulatory caps on digital screen brightness/usage.

### **Candidate 3: Project Alpha (Magnum "Physical" RMN)**
*   **Simple Explanation:** Transforming physical grocery stores into advertising platforms by using digital screens on shelves and sending push notifications to shoppers' phones while they are in the aisle.
*   **Verdict:** 🟡 **BUY WITH PIVOT**
*   **Concept:** Monetizing 200+ physical stores via digital screens and loyalty data.
*   **Strategic Detail:** **CRITICAL PIVOT REQUIRED.** Due diligence confirms **Kaspi.kz owns 90% of Magnum’s e-commerce venture**. We must abandon the "Online RMN" goal as the digital storefront is legally and technically controlled by Kaspi. The venture must focus strictly on **Offline/Phygital** inventory where Magnum retains 100% sovereignty.
*   **Execution Mechanism:**
    *   **In-Store Digital:** Deploy **Digital Shelf Edge Screens** (Video Rails) and upgrade "Smart Scales" to programmatic endpoints.
    *   **Loyalty Loop:** Use the "Magnum Club" app (controlled by Magnum) to trigger push notifications to users *while they are physically in-store*, based on their historical offline purchase data.
*   **Financial Assessment:**
    *   **Revenue Model:** Direct sale of high-margin "Digital Trade Marketing" packages to FMCG giants (P&G, Nestlé) who crave offline attribution.
    *   **ROI Potential:** 2.5x (Lower due to high hardware CapEx for screens).
    *   **Primary Risk:** High operational overhead of maintaining physical hardware across 200+ remote locations.

### **Candidate 4: Project Beta + Eta (Sovereign Language AI SaaS)**
*   **Simple Explanation:** A software tool for ad agencies that uses AI to automatically translate and adapt advertisements into the Kazakh language, ensuring they meet legal requirements and sound natural.
*   **Verdict:** 🟡 **BUY (Venture Bet)**
*   **Concept:** Unified "Creative + Voice" compliance and automation tool for Kazakh content.
*   **Strategic Detail:** The **Jan 2026 AI Law** creates a "Regulatory Moat." It mandates deepfake labeling and removes copyright from "AI-only" works, but explicitly protects "creative prompts." Our project wins by providing a "Human-in-the-loop" SaaS workflow that guarantees legal compliance and copyright protection for brands.
*   **Execution Mechanism:**
    *   **Tech Stack:** Build on top of the open-source **KSC2 (Kazakh Speech Corpus 2)** and **AlemLLM** rather than training a new base model.
    *   **Product:** A "Transcreation Engine" that automatically adapts Russian/English ad copy into culturally nuanced Kazakh (handling code-switching) and checks for legal compliance (font size, language ratios).
*   **Financial Assessment:**
    *   **Revenue Model:** SaaS Subscription for advertising agencies, call centers, and government bodies.
    *   **ROI Potential:** 10x (High Alpha / High Risk).
    *   **Primary Risk:** Rapid improvement of Kazakh language support in global models (GPT-5/Gemini) rendering the "translation" feature obsolete.

### **Candidate 5: Project Gamma (Wildberries Influencer CPA)**
*   **Simple Explanation:** A platform where social media influencers get a unique link to products on Wildberries and automatically get paid a commission every time someone buys through that link.
*   **Verdict:** 🟠 **SPECULATIVE BUY**
*   **Concept:** An automated performance platform for influencers focusing on **Wildberries**.
*   **Strategic Detail:** Kaspi remains a "Black Box" for external tracking. However, **Wildberries sales in KZ grew 99% in 2024**, and their **"Wibes"** API is operational. This is the only "performance" play viable in the current marketplace environment.
*   **Execution Mechanism:**
    *   **The Wrapper:** Build a simplified mobile interface for micro-influencers to generate "Wibes" deep-links.
    *   **Tax Engine:** Integrate with **Wooppay** or **Qiwi** Mass Payout APIs to automatically calculate and withhold the "Blogger Tax" (1% or 3%) for thousands of self-employed creators, solving the compliance friction.
*   **Financial Assessment:**
    *   **Revenue Model:** 5-10% commission on verified sales (GMV) driven by the platform.
    *   **ROI Potential:** 3x.
    *   **Primary Risk:** Platform risk—Wildberries could shut down API access or launch a competing internal tool.

## 3. Projects Rejected (The "Kill List")

| Project | Reason for Rejection | Detailed Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Robotic Carts (Taro)**<br>*(Simple: Robots that follow warehouse workers to help them pick orders)* | **Negative ROI** | The "Taro" system costs ~$250,000. Warehouse wages in KZ are still low ($400-$600/mo). The payback period exceeds the useful life of the hardware. |
| **Box Retail (Unmanned)**<br>*(Simple: Staffless shipping container stores placed in apartment complexes)* | **Regulatory Friction** | Placing staffless containers (BingoBox style) in Almaty residential zones faces a complex "gray zone" regarding land use permits and utility connections. |
| **Transparent LED**<br>*(Simple: See-through screens for glass elevators)* | **Niche/Vanity** | While **MUXWAVE** tech is impressive, the CapEx is ~$1,500/sqm. The Total Addressable Market is limited to 2-3 luxury malls (Esentai, Dostyk Plaza), making venture-scale returns impossible. |
| **Logistics Middleware (Zeta)**<br>*(Simple: Software to connect Chinese sellers to Kazakh warehouses)* | **Execution Risk** | The specific vendor "Omniful" has no verified operational presence or support team in Kazakhstan. The market is dominated by entrenched "gray" logistics players difficult to displace with software alone. |

## 4. Final Recommendation
The Investment Committee should prioritize **Project Epsilon (Halyk)** and **Project Delta (Citix)** as the anchor assets of the portfolio. These represent scalable, defensible infrastructure. **Project Alpha (Magnum)** should only receive capital if the management agrees to a "Physical-Only" RMN roadmap. **AI and Influencer** projects should be treated as seed-stage options with limited initial exposure.
