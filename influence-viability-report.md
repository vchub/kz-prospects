# Deep Search Report: Why "Project Gamma" (CPA Influencer Exchange) Hasn't Scaled in Kazakhstan

**Date:** January 31, 2026
**Subject:** Feasibility & Blockers Analysis for Automated Influencer Performance Platform

## Executive Summary
The concept of a "CPA Influencer Exchange" (paying influencers per sale rather than per post) is theoretically sound but faces a critical structural blockage: **The "Kaspi Wall."**
Because Kaspi.kz controls ~70-80% of e-commerce payments and refuses to offer an external affiliate tracking API, a third-party platform cannot technically attribute sales to influencers for the majority of the market. This forces the ecosystem to remain on a "Flat Fee" model.

However, a window of opportunity exists with **Wildberries (Wibes program)** and independent retailers (Magnum/Technodom), provided the platform can solve the "Trust Gap" regarding payouts.

## 1. Structural Blockers (Why it hasn't happened)

### A. The "Kaspi Wall" (Technical Dead End)
*   **The Issue:** A CPA model requires a "Pixel" or API trigger to confirm a sale occurred.
*   **Finding:** Kaspi.kz does **not** provide a public affiliate API or allow third-party tracking pixels.
*   **Impact:** If an influencer drives a user to Kaspi to buy a Samsung fridge, the platform *cannot see the sale*. The attribution chain is broken. This creates a "Black Box" that prevents performance-based payouts for the market leader.

### B. The "Trust Gap" (Cultural Friction)
*   **The Issue:** Influencers fear brands will under-report sales to avoid paying commissions.
*   **Finding:** Research indicates a "Trust Gap" in the KZ market. Micro-influencers (54.5% of the market) prefer "safe" flat fees (even small ones) over the "risk" of CPA because they lack transparency into the brand's backend.
*   **Impact:** Without a neutral 3rd party auditor (the platform), influencers refuse CPA deals.

### C. Tax Administration (Solved but Complex)
*   **The Issue:** Onboarding 5,000 freelancers usually creates a tax nightmare.
*   **Finding:** This is actually **solvable**. New laws (March 2024) mandate influencer registration. Platforms like **Wooppay** and **Qiwi** offer "Mass Payout" APIs that can automate tax withholding for self-employed individuals. The infrastructure exists; it just hasn't been productized for this specific niche.

## 2. Competitive Landscape (The Void)

*   **Global Players:** **Admitad** is present but focuses on "Webmasters" (SEO/Arbitrage), not social influencers. **Perfluence** (Russia) is active in the CIS but has not aggressively localized for Kazakhstan (e.g., Kazakh language support, local integration with Magnum).
*   **Local Agencies:** Agencies like **JKS Entertainment** dominate the *top tier* (TikTok houses) but operate on an "Agency Retainer" model. They have no incentive to automate themselves out of a job.
*   **The Gap:** There is no "Self-Service" platform for the long tail of 5k-50k follower micro-influencers.

## 3. Viability Verdict & Strategic Pivot

**Is it viable?**
*   **As a "General" CPA Platform:** **NO.** You cannot monetize Kaspi traffic.
*   **As a "Non-Kaspi" Aggregator:** **YES.**

**The Winning Strategy:**
1.  **Wrap Wildberries:** Build the platform on top of the **Wildberries "Wibes" API** (which *does* exist). Allow local influencers to easily generate deep-links for WB products.
2.  **Integrate Magnum/Technodom:** Use the "Project Alpha" (RMN) integration to provide exclusive attribution for these retailers.
3.  **"Tax Agent" Value Prop:** Market the platform to influencers not just as "revenue," but as "safety." *("We handle your tax filings automatically so you don't get fined.")*

## 4. Key Risks
*   **Kaspi Retaliation:** Kaspi could launch its own internal "Influencer Program" (similar to Amazon Influencers), wiping out third-party platforms overnight.
*   **Influencer Education:** Converting users from "Easy Cash" (Flat fee) to "Hustle" (CPA) requires significant education and higher potential upside.
