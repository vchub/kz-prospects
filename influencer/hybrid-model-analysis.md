# Strategic Analysis: "Project Gamma" Pivot to Hybrid Model

**Date:** February 2, 2026
**Subject:** Moving from Pure CPA to Hybrid (Fixed + Performance) for Micro-Influencers

## 1. Executive Summary: The "Hybrid" Logic
The decision to pivot from a pure CPA (Cost Per Action) model to a **Hybrid Model (Small Fixed Fee + Performance Bonus)** is strategically sound and necessary for the Kazakhstan market.

*   **Why Pure CPA Failed:** Micro-influencers in KZ are cash-poor and risk-averse. They cannot afford to work for free on the *chance* of a sale, especially given the "Kaspi Wall" tracking issues.
*   **Why Hybrid Wins:**
    *   **For Influencers:** The "Fixed Fee" (e.g., 5,000 - 10,000 KZT) covers their production costs and guarantees they aren't exploited.
    *   **For Brands:** The "Performance Bonus" (CPA/CPC) keeps the influencer motivated to sell, not just post.
    *   **The Sweet Spot:** This creates a "Salary + Commission" mindset that professionalizes the micro-tier.

## 2. The Core Value Propositions

### A. Ease of Getting a Brand Offer ("Tinder for Creators")
*   **The Problem:** Currently, micro-influencers spend 80% of their time DMing brands and getting ignored.
*   **The Solution:**
    *   **Auto-Match:** Influencer sets tags (e.g., #Beauty #Almaty). Brand sets targets.
    *   **One-Click Apply:** "XYZ Brand wants 5 Stories. Pay: 10k Fixed + 5% Sales. Do you accept?" -> [YES/NO].
    *   **No Negotiation:** Terms are standardized. Take it or leave it.

### B. Ease of Getting Paid ("Fintech Layer")
*   **The Problem:** Brands pay net-30 or net-60 days. Micro-influencers need money *today* for lunch/taxi.
*   **The Solution:** **Instant Factoring.**
    *   Platform pays the influencer **immediately** upon content approval (minus a small % fee).
    *   Platform waits 30 days to get paid by the Brand.
    *   *Why this is a killer feature:* It turns the platform into a "Daily Paycheck" for young creators.

## 3. "What Else?" (The Sticky Services)

To lock in influencers and prevent them from going direct to brands, the platform must offer tools they cannot get elsewhere.

### Feature 1: The "Kazakh AI Scriptwriter" (Critical Differentiator)
*   **The Pain:** Many micro-influencers struggle to write "selling" captions, especially in native Kazakh. Global AI (ChatGPT) sounds robotic or uses Russian calques.
*   **The Service:** Integrated AI tool using local models (like KazLLM/Tilqazyna).
    *   *Input:* "Lipstick, Red, Evening Date."
    *   *Output:* A 15-second TikTok script in natural, slang-appropriate Kazakh with a hook and CTA.
    *   *Benefit:* Increases conversion for the brand, makes content creation faster for the creator.

### Feature 2: The "Tax Robot" (Compliance Shield)
*   **The Pain:** The 2025/2026 Tax Code fines are scary. Influencers don't know how to file.
*   **The Service:**
    *   Platform acts as the "Tax Agent."
    *   "We withhold your 3% tax automatically. You get net cash. We file the report for you."
    *   *Benefit:* Peace of mind. "Use us, and you won't get fined."

### Feature 3: "Safe" Barter & Product Logistics
*   **The Pain:** Brands promise free product but never ship it, or ship it late.
*   **The Service:**
    *   Platform integrates with a courier service (e.g., Glovo/Yandex business).
    *   "Click Accept -> Courier arrives with product in 2 hours."
    *   *Benefit:* Instant gratification for the creator.

### Feature 4: Media Kit Generator
*   **The Pain:** Creators send ugly screenshots of their stats.
*   **The Service:**
    *   Real-time API pull of their views/engagement.
    *   Generates a beautiful PDF "CV" they can share.
    *   *Benefit:* Professionalism (and free marketing for the platform, as the PDF has your logo).

## 4. Addressing the "Tracking" Elephant
How do we track the "Performance" part (CPC/CPA) in a Hybrid model?

*   **Scenario A: Wildberries (Wibes)**
    *   *Tracking:* DeepLink / API.
    *   *Metric:* CPA (Sale) is possible.
*   **Scenario B: Kaspi / Offline Retail**
    *   *Tracking:* Impossible to track deep links reliably.
    *   *Metric Shift:* Move to **CPV (Cost Per Verified View)** or **CPC (Cost Per Click)** to a Landing Page.
    *   *The "Landing Page" Trick:* The link goes to a Platform-hosted "Pre-lander" (e.g., "See Price"). We track the *intent* (the click on the pre-lander), then forward them to Kaspi.
    *   *Payment:* Brand pays for the "Intent Click," not the final Sale. This is fair for the influencer who did their job (driving traffic).

## 5. Strategic Recommendation
**Launch with "The Daily Pay" + "Kazakh AI".**
These two features solve the immediate hunger (cash) and the immediate friction (content creation). The "Hybrid" model is just the math; the *value* is in the speed and cultural relevance.
