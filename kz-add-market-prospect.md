# Strategic Analysis of the Advertising Ecosystem in the Republic of Kazakhstan (2025–2026): Market Dynamics, Comparative Gaps, and Prospective Ventures

## Executive Summary

The advertising market of the Republic of Kazakhstan has entered a definitive phase of maturation and structural transformation as of early 2025. No longer merely a satellite market of the post-Soviet space, Kazakhstan has developed a unique digital ecosystem characterized by the "Super App" hegemony of Kaspi.kz, a rapidly digitizing consumer base with 92.9% internet penetration, and a burgeoning, albeit fragmented, AdTech landscape [1].

Current market analysis indicates a robust expansion trajectory, with the total advertising market growing by 17% in the first half of 2025 to reach 27 billion KZT, driven predominantly by a 29% surge in digital advertising revenues [1]. However, this growth masks significant structural asymmetries. The market is bifurcated between a highly advanced fintech-driven digital layer and a traditional media sector struggling with inventory shortages, regulatory tightening regarding the Kazakh language, and inflationary pressures [4].

When compared to mature markets like the United States and regional benchmarks like Russia, Kazakhstan exhibits distinct "white spaces." Specifically, the market lacks the diversified Retail Media Network (RMN) landscape seen in the USA (where every major retailer is an ad publisher) and the sophisticated, automated CPA (Cost-Per-Action) influencer networks prevalent in Russia [5].

This report provides an exhaustive evaluation of these trends. It argues that the most prospective development projects lie not in replicating global models, but in adapting them to local realities: specifically, the creation of independent RMNs for major retailers (Magnum, Technodom) to challenge Kaspi's monopoly, the development of generative AI for Kazakh-language creative production, and the industrialization of influencer performance marketing.

## 1. Macroeconomic Context and Digital Infrastructure

To understand the velocity of the advertising market, one must analyze the underlying economic and infrastructural engines driving consumer behavior.

### 1.1 Economic Indicators and Consumer Confidence

The first four months of 2025 saw Kazakhstan's GDP grow by 6%, a strong indicator of economic resilience [7]. This growth was underpinned by a 7% expansion in the trade sector and a 22.4% surge in transport, reflecting heightened commercial activity and logistics throughput [7]. For advertisers, this signals a widening middle class with increasing disposable income, though inflationary pressures remain a concern for cost-per-acquisition (CPA) metrics.

The digital economy has become the primary growth vector. The e-commerce market alone was valued at approximately $9.92 billion in 2024, with forecasts predicting an annualized turnover increase of 20–30% through 2025 [8]. E-commerce is no longer a niche channel; it is central to the retail economy, fundamentally altering how brands budget for "bottom-of-the-funnel" conversions.

### 1.2 Digital Penetration and Connectivity

Kazakhstan boasts digital infrastructure metrics that rival developed European nations, creating a high-bandwidth environment suitable for rich media and video advertising.

**Table 1: Key Digital Infrastructure Metrics (2025)**

| Metric | Value | Year-on-Year Trend | Implications for Advertisers |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Internet Users** | 19.2 Million (92.9% of population) | Stable saturation | Digital reach is effectively total reach; "offline only" audiences are negligible. [1] |
| **Mobile Speed** | +51.3% increase in download speed | Significant Growth | Enables high-fidelity video ads (4K), AR experiences, and complex mobile web apps without latency friction. [1] |
| **Social Media Users** | 15.7 Million (75.7% of population) | +11.2% Growth | Social platforms are the de facto "television" for Gen Z and Millennials. [3] |
| **E-commerce Share** | 14.1% of Total Retail | Rapid Expansion | The "shelf" is digital; visibility on marketplaces is more critical than physical slotting fees. [8] |

This infrastructure supports a sophisticated consumer who demands seamless omnichannel experiences. The high mobile internet speeds specifically facilitate the rise of heavy-content formats like short-form video (TikTok, Instagram Reels) and programmatic Digital Out-of-Home (DOOH) integrations, which require real-time data transfer [3].

## 2. The Advertising Landscape: 2024–2025 Trends

The market is currently experiencing a "digital flip," where internet advertising expenditures are poised to permanently overtake television.

### 2.1 Market Volume and Growth Vectors

Data from the first half of 2025 indicates a total market volume of 27 billion KZT, representing a 17% year-over-year increase [1]. This growth is outpacing GDP, suggesting that advertising intensity (ad spend as a % of GDP) is rising as competition heats up.

- **Digital Leadership:** The internet segment grew by 29%, generating 14 billion KZT in H1 2025 alone [1]. This acceleration is driven by the adoption of automation tools and the influx of SME advertisers who prefer the low barrier to entry of digital platforms over traditional media [3].
- **Television Resilience:** Contrary to global trends of steep decline, TV in Kazakhstan grew by 25% in 2024 [4]. This anomaly is explained by the "trust factor" and the need for mass reach in the regions. However, TV's share of the total media budget (43% in 2024) is under siege from digital (39%), with parity expected by late 2025 [4].

### 2.2 Media Inflation and Inventory Shortage

A critical trend defining 2025 is **media inflation**. The cost of reaching consumers is rising faster than general inflation.

- **TV Inventory Crisis:** Strict regulations limit advertising to 12 minutes per hour [4]. Combined with high demand, this creates a "sold-out" situation for prime time, forcing prices up and pushing advertisers toward alternative channels.
- **Language-Driven Scarcity:** Legislation mandates that 50% of broadcast content (rising to 60% by 2027) must be in the Kazakh language [4]. There is a chronic shortage of high-quality, brand-safe Kazakh-language content, limiting the available inventory for advertisers who wish to comply with the law while reaching mass audiences [4].

### 2.3 The Agency Ecosystem

The market is serviced by a mix of international holding groups and strong local independent agencies, structured to handle both global brand mandates and local agile requirements.

**Table 2: Key Advertising Agency Players in Kazakhstan**

| Agency / Group | Market Positioning | Key Strengths & Specializations | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **DASM Group** | Market Leader / Holding | Comprehensive media buying, proprietary analytics (DASM Analytics Platform), deep TV/Radio inventory access. | [10] |
| **Publicis Groupe Kazakhstan** | International Network | Developed the "MAKSAT" system for optimizing ad budgets; strong focus on verification and transparency. | [4] |
| **Vostok Group** | Digital Specialist | Focus on digital performance, automation, and programmatic buying; reports heavy growth in digital segments. | [1] |
| **Rocket Firm** | Creative / Digital | High-end creative production, branding, and digital ecosystem design. | [11] |
| **JKS Entertainment** | Influencer / Content | The dominant force in the "Creator Economy," managing TikTok houses (YOLO, Bip) and producing narrative social content. | [12] |
| **Citix** | AdTech / DOOH | Innovator in Smart City DOOH; operates "Smartboard" networks with high-tech programmatic capabilities. | [13] |

The *Digital Wave 2024* conference highlighted a major shift in agency-client relations: a move toward **"Transparency and Verification."** Advertisers are increasingly demanding third-party verification (Integral Ad Science, etc.) to combat fraud and ensure brand safety, a standard long present in the US but just becoming mandatory in Kazakhstan [11].

## 3. Deep Dive: Digital Platforms and the "Super App" Hegemony

The digital advertising advertising market in Kazakhstan is unique due to the overwhelming dominance of a single local player, which distorts the typical Google/Meta duopoly seen elsewhere.

### 3.1 The Kaspi.kz Phenomenon

Kaspi.kz is not merely a bank or a retailer; it is the operating system of the Kazakh consumer economy.

- **Dominance:** Processing over 70% of non-cash transactions and 80% of e-commerce payments [2].
- **The "Walled Garden":** Kaspi operates a closed ecosystem. For advertisers, this presents a "black box" challenge. Unlike Amazon, which has aggressively opened its data to advertisers via Amazon DSP, Kaspi's advertising tools (Kaspi Marketing) are primarily focused on endemic merchants selling *on* the platform [14].
- **Strategic Implication:** Brands cannot ignore Kaspi, but they are also held hostage by its data monopoly. There is no independent "The Trade Desk" equivalent that can target Kaspi users off-platform using Kaspi data.

### 3.2 The Search Engine War: Google vs. Yandex

Kazakhstan remains a battleground between Western and Russian tech stacks.

- **Google:** Dominates mobile search with ~68.5% market share (Oct 2025) and overall search with 60.15% [16]. It is the default for Android and iOS users.
- **Yandex:** Holds a resilient ~32% overall share, but this rises significantly in the desktop environment and among specific Russian-speaking demographics [16]. Yandex's ad stack (Yandex Direct) is crucial for reaching audiences in the broader CIS region and offers superior semantic processing for Russian-language queries [18].
- **Analysis:** Advertisers cannot choose one; a dual-stack strategy is mandatory. Neglecting Yandex means missing a third of the market, often a segment with high purchasing power in urban centers.

### 3.3 Social Media and the Creator Economy

Social platforms have effectively replaced linear TV for the under-35 demographic.

- **TikTok & The "Content House" Model:** Kazakhstan has become a global exporter of TikTok culture. **JKS Entertainment** manages houses like **YOLO House** and **Bip House**, which have tens of millions of followers globally [12]. These are not just teenagers in bedrooms; they are industrial-scale content production units. Brands like Samsung and widespread local entities integrate into their "series" and narrative arcs rather than just buying 30-second spots [19].
- **Instagram:** Remains the primary platform for lifestyle and fashion, particularly for the "Micro-influencer" tier (5k-20k followers), which comprises 54.5% of the influencer market [20].

## 4. Traditional Media Innovation: The Case of Citix

While traditional billboards are declining globally, Kazakhstan's **Citix** has reinvented the medium, creating a "Smart City" advertising network that is arguably ahead of many US implementations in terms of integration.

- **Technology:** Citix "Smartboards" are not just screens; they are IoT devices connected to city data. They use **Dynamic Creative Optimization (DCO)** to change ads based on weather, traffic jams, or time of day [9].
- **Programmatic Leap:** Citix is actively moving toward programmatic selling, allowing buyers to purchase inventory via DSPs rather than direct insertion orders. This brings the efficiency of digital display to physical outdoor assets [21].

## 5. Comparative Gap Analysis

To identify the most prospective opportunities, we must analyze what exists in mature markets (USA, Russia) but is absent or underdeveloped in Kazakhstan.

### 5.1 Missing in Kazakhstan vs. USA

The United States advertising market is defined by the diversification of ad revenue streams across non-traditional publishers.

| Feature | USA Context | Kazakhstan Status | The Strategic Gap |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Retail Media Networks (RMNs)** | Ubiquitous. Amazon ($50B+), Walmart Connect, Target Round, Uber Ads, Marriott Media. Every retailer monetizes its data. [5] | **Monopolistic.** Kaspi is the only true RMN. Major retailers like **Magnum** (Grocery) and **Technodom** (Electronics) have massive data but lack sophisticated external ad platforms. [23] | **Diversified RMN Ecosystem:** There is a critical need for independent RMNs. Suppliers (Coca-Cola, Samsung) need alternatives to Kaspi to influence shoppers at the point of purchase in grocery and electronics sectors. |
| **Measurement & Attribution** | Advanced. Multi-touch attribution (MTA) and Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) are standard. "Closed loop" measurement via loyalty data. [25] | **Rudimentary.** "Measurement and transparency gaps" are top complaints. Advertisers struggle to prove ROI across channels. [11] | **Unified Measurement Standard:** A third-party measurement currency that can track a user from a TV spot to a Kaspi purchase is nonexistent. |
| **Programmatic Saturation** | 90%+ of digital ad spend is programmatic. Vistar/PlaceExchange allow seamless OOH buying. [26] | **Fragmented.** Programmatic is growing but reliant on Google/Yandex. Independent, local programmatic inventory is scarce. [3] | **Local SSPs:** A supply-side platform dedicated to aggregating local Kazakh publishers and OOH inventory for global buyers. |

### 5.2 Missing in Kazakhstan vs. Russia

Russia's market, despite geopolitical isolation, has developed highly efficient internal performance engines.

| Feature | Russia Context | Kazakhstan Status | The Strategic Gap |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CPA Influencer Platforms** | **Perfluence** model: Brands pay influencers *only* for sales generated via promo codes. Automated, large-scale (thousands of micro-influencers). [6] | **Agency/Retainer Model.** Influencer marketing is largely "pay-for-post" or flat fee. Manual negotiation via agencies like JKS. [28] | **Automated Performance Influencer Tech:** A platform that automates the recruitment, tracking, and payout of micro-influencers on a pure CPA basis. |
| **Ecosystem Depth** | **Yandex** is a total ecosystem (Taxi, Food, Market, Maps, Kinopoisk) with a unified ID. Deep cross-service retargeting. | **Bifurcated.** Users split between Kaspi (Fintech), Yandex (Taxi), Wolt (Food), and Google (Search). No single unified ad ID across all these life services. | **Cross-Platform Data Partnerships:** Opportunities for data clean rooms (DCRs) to allow disparate apps (e.g., Wolt + Technodom) to share data securely for targeting. |

## 6. Regulatory Landscape: The "Blogger Tax" and Language Laws

The regulatory environment in 2025 creates both friction and opportunity.

### 6.1 The "Online Platform" Law and Blogger Taxation

New legislation has introduced the concept of the "influencer" into the tax code, requiring the labeling of sponsored content and payment of specific taxes [30].

- **Impact:** This raises the barrier to entry. "Grey" cash payments are becoming dangerous. This favors the development of professional agencies and platforms that can handle tax compliance for brands and creators automatically.
- **Fakes & Liability:** Strict fines for disinformation ($312 for bloggers, higher for platforms) compel a higher standard of verification for ad claims [30].

### 6.2 The Language Imperative

The "On Mass Media" law requires a steady increase in Kazakh-language content.

- **The Constraint:** There is a severe shortage of ad inventory that is *natively* Kazakh [4]. Placing Russian ads on Kazakh channels is increasingly restricted or culturally ineffective.
- **The Opportunity:** AdTech that solves this—specifically AI translation and content generation—is desperately needed.

## 7. Prospective Developments and Projects

Based on the gap analysis and current market trajectory, the following four developments represent the highest potential for return on investment and market impact in Kazakhstan.

### 7.1 Project Alpha: The "Magnum" Retail Media Network

**Concept:** Transforming **Magnum Cash & Carry** (the largest grocery retailer) into a digital media publisher.

- **Rationale:** Magnum possesses high-frequency transaction data that Kaspi lacks (grocery/FMCG). Global FMCG brands (Nestle, P&G, Mars) are desperate for shopper data to target ads and measure lift.
- **Execution:** Building a self-service ad platform where suppliers can bid for "sponsored products" in the Magnum app and digital screens in-store. This replicates the **Walmart Connect** model in the USA [5].
- **Why it wins:** It creates a new high-margin revenue stream for the retailer and gives brands an alternative to the Kaspi/Google duopoly.

### 7.2 Project Beta: Generative AI for Kazakh Ad Creative

**Concept:** A specialized GenAI platform (built on local LLMs like **Alem.AI** or **Cybernet AI**) for marketing transcreation.

- **Rationale:** The "inventory shortage" in Kazakh media is actually a "content shortage." Brands have assets in English/Russian but cannot adapt them fast enough.
- **Execution:** An AI tool that takes a Russian/English video or banner and instantly generates a culturally accurate, legally compliant Kazakh version (voiceover + text).
- **Why it wins:** It solves a legal compliance headache for international brands and unlocks the 60%+ of the market that prefers Kazakh content [31].

### 7.3 Project Gamma: The "CPA" Influencer Exchange

**Concept:** An automated performance marketing platform for influencers, modeled on Russia's **Perfluence**.

- **Rationale:** The new tax laws make manual influencer management expensive. Brands want ROI, not just likes.
- **Execution:** A platform where brands upload offers (e.g., "10% commission on every sneaker sold") and thousands of verified, tax-compliant micro-influencers can grab the offer and post immediately.
- **Why it wins:** It industrializes the "long tail" of the influencer market, which is currently inefficient to access manually.

### 7.4 Project Delta: Programmatic Outdoor Exchange (Citix Global Integration)

**Concept:** Fully integrating the **Citix** smartboard network with global DSPs (The Trade Desk, DV360).

- **Rationale:** To attract global ad spend, Kazakh inventory must be buyable from New York or London without emails or phone calls.
- **Execution:** Implementing standards (OpenRTB) to make Almaty's billboards bid-able in real-time auctions globally.
- **Why it wins:** It brings foreign capital into the Kazakh ad market and increases yield for asset owners [21].

## 8. Conclusion

The Kazakhstan advertising market is not merely growing; it is **evolving** into a distinct species of digital ecosystem. It is characterized by high tech-savviness but low market diversification. The "Super App" gravity of Kaspi.kz has created a highly efficient but closed loop.

For investors and developers, the "Blue Ocean" lies in **breaking this loop**: creating independent data harbors (Retail Media Networks), industrializing the creator economy (CPA Platforms), and solving the linguistic barrier through technology (GenAI). The market is no longer about "buying media"; it is about building the infrastructure that allows media to be bought efficiently, compliantly, and in the local language.

The gap between the US/Russia and Kazakhstan is not a deficit of demand—consumers are ready—but a deficit of **AdTech middleware**. Filling this gap is the primary opportunity for the 2025–2026 cycle.
