# Strategic Analysis of the Advertising, BTL, and Promotion Markets: Kazakhstan vs. China (2025)

## Executive Strategic Overview
The advertising and promotional landscape of Kazakhstan in 2025 stands at a complex intersection of rapid digital maturity and structural physical stagnation. As the economic engine of Central Asia, Kazakhstan has successfully cultivated a "mobile-first" consumer base that rivals Western markets in connectivity and app usage. However, the physical retail and Below-The-Line (BTL) sectors face a "hardware gap" and a "labor crisis" that prevents them from mirroring the experiential sophistication seen in the People's Republic of China.

This report offers an exhaustive examination of these dynamics. We analyze the dichotomy of a market where digital advertising spend is surging by 17-29% annually, driven by local super-apps and retail media, while traditional BTL channels wither due to shifting labor demographics and a lack of technological integration. Furthermore, by benchmarking Kazakhstan against China’s "New Retail" ecosystem—characterized by Online-to-Offline (O2O) loops, holographic displays, and AI-driven community hubs—we identify the specific technologies and strategies currently absent in Central Asia. The analysis reveals that while Kazakhstan has digitized the transaction, it has yet to fully digitize the experience, leaving a significant opportunity for the introduction of Chinese production technologies such as transparent LED infrastructure, RFID-enabled smart retail, and automated promotional hardware.

## Part I: The Macro-Environmental Context of Kazakhstan’s Marketing Sphere (2024-2025)
To fully comprehend the shifts in advertising and promotion, one must first dissect the demographic and technological substrate of the Kazakh market. The year 2025 marks a turning point where digital saturation has forced a change in strategy from "acquisition" to "retention and monetization."

### 1.1 Digital Infrastructure as the Primary Ad-Server
The fundamental driver of advertising growth in Kazakhstan is the omnipresence of high-speed mobile internet. By January 2025, the number of internet users in Kazakhstan reached 19.2 million, creating a penetration rate of 92.9% [1]. This is not merely a statistic of access but of capability. The average mobile internet connection speed surged by 51.3% year-over-year to 53.69 Mbps [2]. This bandwidth expansion is critical for the advertising market because it lowers the latency barrier for high-definition video advertising, augmented reality (AR) filters, and rich media formats in programmatic environments.

The "offline" population has shrunk to approximately 1.48 million people, mostly in remote rural areas, effectively meaning that for mass-market advertisers, the "digital" audience is synonymous with the "total" audience [1]. Consequently, the advertising market is no longer viewing digital as a separate silo but as the foundational layer of all communication.

### 1.2 The Demographic Shift and Labor Market Impact on BTL
A critical, often overlooked factor influencing the BTL and promotion market is the structural change in Kazakhstan's workforce. The "Promoter" economy—reliant on cheap, abundant youth labor for sampling, leafleting, and in-store activation—is collapsing under the weight of demographic and aspirational shifts.

Analysis of labor market data reveals a stagnation in youth entrepreneurship and a radical shift in career preferences. The number of young individual entrepreneurs has flatlined with only 0.2% growth over two years, while the IT sector has seen a massive influx of interest [3]. There are now nearly 17 resumes for every IT vacancy in major hubs like Almaty and Astana [4]. This indicates that the demographic cohort (students, young adults) that traditionally filled low-wage BTL roles is now upskilling, seeking remote digital work, or entering the gig economy (couriers/taxi) which offers higher autonomy and wages than standing in a supermarket aisle.

Furthermore, regional disparities exacerbate this issue. While Almaty and Astana concentrate over 200,000 active young entrepreneurs and the bulk of economic activity, regions like Ulytau have as few as 6,700 young entrepreneurs [3]. For national BTL campaigns, this creates a logistical nightmare: agencies can easily staff activations in the capital, but struggle to find reliable personnel in the regions, forcing a reliance on digital channels to reach those geographies.

### 1.3 Economic Confidence and Ad Spend Recovery
Despite these structural challenges, the overall economic sentiment has fueled a recovery in ad budgets. The advertising market grew by 17% in the first half of 2025, reaching 27 billion KZT [5]. This growth is outpacing inflation, signaling real investment. However, this capital is not flowing evenly. It is concentrating in channels that offer "performance" and "measurability"—namely, digital and retail media—while traditional brand-building channels face scrutiny over efficiency.

## Part II: The Advertising Market Analysis – Trends and Declines
The advertising market in Kazakhstan is experiencing a "K-shaped" recovery. Modern, data-driven channels are on a steep upward trajectory, while legacy formats and even some "first-generation" digital channels are entering a phase of decline.

### 2.1 Trending Sectors: The Rise of Retail Media and Sovereign Content

**The Explosive Growth of Retail Media**
The most significant trend in 2025 is the migration of advertising budgets from "Search" and "Social" to Retail Media—advertising placements sold by e-commerce marketplaces. With e-commerce growing by 42% year-on-year and marketplaces like Kaspi, Wildberries, and Ozon accounting for up to 91% of all online sales, these platforms have become the primary search engines for product discovery [2].

Brands have realized that the "distance to purchase" on a marketplace is zero clicks. Consequently, FMCG, electronics, and fashion brands are shifting their trade marketing budgets into "internal" marketplace ads (banners, sponsored listings, push notifications). This sector is growing at "record speed" because it offers closed-loop attribution: an advertiser knows exactly how much revenue an ad generated, a metric that television and outdoor advertising struggle to provide [2].

**The "Kazakh-First" Content Imperative**
A profound cultural shift is dictating creative strategy. The era of adapting Russian-language content for the Kazakh market is ending. In 2025, 60-65% of the audience prefers content in the Kazakh language [2]. This has birthed a new market for "Sovereign Content"—advertising originally concepted and produced in Kazakh, leveraging local cultural codes rather than translation.

Platforms like BIRGE TV and specific Telegram communities have emerged as key vehicles for this content. Telegram, in particular, has evolved into a "Super App" in Kazakhstan, covering 60% of the population [2]. It is no longer just a messenger but a media ecosystem where brands run native integrations in channels, build automated bots for customer service, and deploy "Mini Apps" for e-commerce within the chat interface. This trend is distinct from the West, where WhatsApp (a closed ecosystem) dominates, and aligns more closely with the WeChat model in China.

**Mobile Programmatic and "Brandformance"**
With 86% of ad traffic originating from mobile devices, the programmatic market has matured [2]. Agencies are moving beyond basic display ads to "In-App" video and Rich Media formats. The dominant strategic framework is now "Brandformance"—a hybrid approach where every branding campaign is rigorously measured against performance metrics (clicks, installs, leads). This is driven by the capabilities of platforms like BYYD and Vostok Group, which allow for precise targeting based on device IDs, location, and app usage patterns [2].

### 2.2 Declining Sectors: The Fall of Legacy Search and Static Media

**The Crisis of Traditional Search (SEO/SEM)**
Perhaps the most alarming trend for traditional digital agencies is the sharp decline in Search Engine Marketing (SEM) efficiency. Click-through rates (CTR) for top search positions have dropped by 34.5%, and organic traffic has plummeted by up to 70% in some verticals [2].

This phenomenon is driven by the integration of Generative AI (like Gemini, Copilot, and ChatGPT) into search experiences. Users are now receiving "Zero-Click" answers—summaries provided by AI directly on the search results page—eliminating the need to visit a brand's website. For informational queries (e.g., "best smartphone under 200,000 KZT"), the AI provides the answer. This is forcing advertisers to abandon "informational" SEO strategies and focus purely on "transactional" keywords or move budget to video and social platforms where AI cannot yet fully replace the consumption experience [2].

**The Erosion of Print and Static OOH**
Traditional media continues its slow contraction. While Outdoor Advertising (OOH) remains visible in major cities, it is facing high inflation and regulatory pressure. The cost of placement is rising due to tax increases and the dismantling of illegal structures, while the inventory of prime locations is shrinking [6]. Consequently, advertisers are abandoning static billboards in favor of Digital Out-of-Home (DOOH), which allows for programmatic buying and changing creatives based on time of day or weather. Print media has been relegated to a niche luxury status, losing mass-market relevance entirely [6].

### 2.3 Data Summary: Growth vs. Decline Vectors

| Channel/Format | Status | Drivers of Change |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Retail Media (Marketplaces)** | 🚀 Booming | 42% E-commerce growth; High conversion attribution. [2] |
| **Kazakh-Language Video** | 📈 Trending | 65% audience preference; Rise of domestic content platforms. [2] |
| **Telegram Ads & Bots** | 📈 Trending | 60% population coverage; Super-app functionality. [2] |
| **Programmatic In-App** | 📈 Trending | 86% mobile traffic share; Demand for measurability. [2] |
| **Traditional Search (Google)** | 📉 Declining | AI "Zero-Click" behavior; -34.5% CTR drop. [2] |
| **Static Billboards** | 📉 Declining | Media inflation; Regulatory reduction of inventory. [6] |
| **Traditional Leafleting** | 📉 Collapsing | Labor shortage; Rising wages; Low efficiency. [3] |

## Part III: The BTL and Promotion Ecosystem – A Sector in Transformation
The Below-The-Line (BTL) market in Kazakhstan acts as the physical counterpart to the digital ad market. However, unlike the streamlined efficiency of digital, the BTL sector is messy, labor-intensive, and currently bifurcating into "Low-Value" and "High-Value" segments.

### 3.1 The Collapse of the "Promoter Economy"
For decades, BTL in Kazakhstan relied on an army of students willing to work for low wages as promoters, leafleteers, and samplers. In 2025, this model is breaking down.

**The Labor Crunch:** The demand for low-skilled labor is being cannibalized by the "gig economy" (Glovo, Yandex Taxi) and the aspirational shift toward the IT sector. With young people seeing peers earn 700,000+ KZT in junior data analyst roles [4], the appeal of standing in a Magnum supermarket for minimum wage has vanished. Agencies report difficulty in staffing large-scale sampling campaigns, particularly in regions where the youth population is thinning due to migration to Almaty and Astana [8].

**The Efficiency Problem:** Even when staff is available, the efficiency of analog promotion is questionable. In a market where digital ads offer cost-per-click transparency, paying for "hours worked" by a promoter with no guarantee of engagement is becoming harder to justify to CMOs.

### 3.2 The Renaissance of Event Marketing and Festivals
Conversely, the "High-Value" segment of BTL—Event Marketing—is experiencing a renaissance. Brands are pivoting from small-scale in-store interactions to massive, immersive activations at festivals and public events.

**The "Experience" Economy:** Post-pandemic "revenge socializing" has sustained a demand for live events. Brands like Coca-Cola have mastered this. At music festivals, Coca-Cola does not merely sponsor a stage; they build entire "Experience Zones" featuring branded terraces, mixology bars (mixing products with Absolut), and "DJ Academies" where attendees can learn to mix tracks [10]. These activations transform the BTL touchpoint into a content creation studio, generating social media assets that live on long after the event.

**PepsiCo's Industrial BTL:** PepsiCo is taking a different route, leveraging its massive infrastructure investment—a new snack plant in Almaty that will be the largest in Central Asia—to drive regional dominance [11]. Their BTL strategy is likely to focus on "Local Pride," emphasizing the use of local potatoes and raw materials to endear the brand to the Kazakh consumer, creating a narrative of economic contribution rather than just consumption.

### 3.3 The "Smart BTL" Innovation: Magnum's Telegram Integration
A prime example of innovation in this space is the retailer Magnum Cash & Carry. Facing the challenge of engaging customers in-store without adding labor costs, Magnum utilized the digital screens on their weighing scales (previously a dead space).
* **Mechanism:** They connected these screens to a centralized ad server managed via a Telegram bot.
* **Outcome:** Marketing teams can now deploy ads, job openings, or promotions to 700+ scales across the country instantly. This "Internet of Things" (IoT) approach automates the BTL function, turning a utility device into a media channel and solving the labor dependency issue [12].

### 3.4 Key Players and Agency Capabilities
The market is served by a mix of local giants and international affiliates.
* **EZ Solutions:** A leader in corporate events with a footprint across Central Asia (Almaty, Astana, Tashkent, Bishkek). Their portfolio emphasizes the logistical capacity to handle cross-border campaigns, which is crucial for multinationals managing the "STAN" region (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan) as a single block [13].
* **Global Air & Action Kazakhstan:** These agencies specialize in the "MICE" (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, Exhibitions) sector, servicing high-profile clients like British Airways and Carlsberg. Their strength lies in "Government Relations" (GR) and navigating the complex regulatory environment of public events in Kazakhstan [14].
* **MYD Production:** This agency represents the "infrastructure" side of promotion, managing advertising rights at major airports (Almaty, Astana). They are notable for introducing eco-friendly practices (recycling boxes, FSC paper) and innovative hardware like holographic fans, attempting to bridge the technological gap [16].

## Part IV: The China Benchmark – What is Missing in Kazakhstan?
To understand the future trajectory of Kazakhstan, we must look to China. The Chinese market operates on a technological and conceptual plane that is approximately 3-5 years ahead of Central Asia. The gap is not just in spending but in the nature of the interaction between brand and consumer.

### 4.1 The Conceptual Gap: O2O vs. Multichannel
In Kazakhstan, "Online" and "Offline" are treated as separate channels with some crossover (e.g., click-and-collect). In China, the Online-to-Offline (O2O) loop is seamless and continuous.

**The Chinese Model:** A consumer in Shanghai might watch a Douyin (TikTok) livestream, receive a digital coupon, walk to a physical store where their face is recognized at the entrance (alerting staff to their preferences), try on clothes using an RFID smart mirror that suggests accessories, and pay via facial recognition—all while the transaction data feeds back into the Douyin algorithm to refine future ads [17].

**The Missing Element in KZ:** While Kazakhstan has the "Super App" (Kaspi) for payments, it lacks the "Physical Layer" of data integration. Kaspi knows what you bought, but the physical store doesn't know you are there until you pay. The "pre-purchase" in-store behavior (browsing, trying on) remains a data black hole in Kazakhstan, whereas in China, it is fully digitized via sensors and AI cameras.

### 4.2 The "Community Hub" Retail Model
China has moved beyond "Transactional Retail." As e-commerce devours commodity sales, physical stores in China have pivoted to become "Community Hubs."
* **Rapha (Shanghai):** The store is a clubhouse for cyclists, hosting rides and events, with retail being secondary.
* **Li-Ning:** Stores are "Culture Centers" blending sport and Chinese heritage.
* **Trend:** "One-Day Store Managers" where influencers run the shop, turning retail operations into a reality show/content event [19].

**Contrast:** Kazakh malls (Mega, Dostyk Plaza, Esentai) are world-class in construction but traditional in function. They are collections of transaction points. The concept of a store not designed primarily to sell product per square meter, but to generate "community engagement," is largely absent outside of a few coffee chains.

### 4.3 Production Technologies: The "Hardware Gap"
The most visible difference is in the display and interaction technologies used in Chinese retail. Because these technologies are manufactured in China (Shenzhen/Guangdong), domestic adoption is cheap and widespread. In Kazakhstan, these are expensive imports, limiting their use to high-end novelty.

**A. Holographic & Transparent LED (The Invisible Screen)**
* **China Tech:** Technologies like MUXWAVE and Leyard Vteam produce "Invisible LED Screens." These are transparent grids (transparency >90%) that mount on glass shop windows. When off, the window looks clear; when on, high-definition 3D holograms float in the air.
* **Application:** Used for "Phantom" mannequins and floating prices that don't block the view of the store interior [20].
* **Missed in KZ:** Kazakhstan relies on standard, opaque LED screens or vinyl stickers. The "Holographic" effect is missing, robbing malls of the futuristic aesthetic that drives foot traffic in China.

**B. Electronic Shelf Labels (ESL) & Dynamic Pricing**
* **China Tech:** ESLs are ubiquitous in chains like Hema (Freshippo). They allow prices to change instantly across thousands of items based on demand, time of day, or expiration status.
* **Application:** "Happy Hour" pricing for fresh food triggers automatically at 7 PM.
* **Missed in KZ:** While Technodom and Magnum are piloting this, widespread adoption is low. Pricing is largely static (paper tags), meaning retailers cannot execute dynamic "surge" or "clearance" pricing strategies effectively in real-time [23].

**C. Smart Mirrors & RFID Fitting Rooms**
* **China Tech:** Mirrors embedded with RFID readers (using JADAK or Impinj tech) recognize the clothes a customer brings in. The mirror becomes a screen, suggesting matching items, allowing the user to request a different size without leaving the room, or adjusting the lighting to simulate "Daylight" or "Evening" [25].
* **Missed in KZ:** Fitting rooms in Almaty are passive spaces. The "Smart Mirror" exists only as a PR stunt, not a standard operational tool. This represents a lost opportunity for upselling at the most critical moment of the purchase journey.

**D. Naked-Eye 3D Billboards**
* **China Tech:** Massive curved LED screens on building corners that use forced perspective to create 3D illusions (e.g., a lion jumping out of the wall) without 3D glasses.
* **Missed in KZ:** Almaty has many LED screens, but they are flat and display standard 2D video. The "Anamorphic" content production and curved hardware required for Naked-Eye 3D are missing, depriving brands of viral OOH moments [16].

## Part V: Strategic Recommendations for Bridging the Gap
Based on the comparative analysis, the following strategies are recommended for stakeholders in the Kazakhstan market to leapfrog the current stagnation.

### 5.1 Automate BTL with "Vending Marketing"
To solve the labor shortage of promoters, agencies should import Smart Vending/Sampling Machines from China. These machines dispense free samples only after the user scans a QR code and follows the brand on Telegram/Instagram.
* **Benefit:** Eliminates the need for unreliable promoters, operates 24/7, and captures 100% accurate customer data (phone numbers/social IDs) for retargeting [26].

### 5.2 Implement "Retail Media" as a Physical Product
Malls like Mega and Dostyk Plaza should install Transparent LED networks on their glass balustrades and atrium lifts.
* **Benefit:** This creates a new, high-value advertising inventory that doesn't clutter the visual space (because it's transparent) but offers high-impact video capacity. It monetizes the "air" inside the mall [21].

### 5.3 Adopt "Sovereign AI" for Copywriting
Agencies must move beyond using generic ChatGPT (which may struggle with Kazakh cultural nuances) and train Local LLMs on Kazakh literature, slang, and advertising history.
* **Benefit:** This allows for the automated generation of high-quality Kazakh-language content at scale, meeting the 65% audience preference requirement without the bottleneck of human copywriters [2].

### 5.4 The "Store as Studio" Model
Retailers should redesign flagship stores to include permanent "Livestreaming Studios."
* **Benefit:** Following the China model, store staff can utilize downtime to livestream products to TikTok/Instagram, effectively turning every sales associate into an influencer and every square meter of the store into a content production set [19].

## Conclusion
In conclusion, while Kazakhstan has built a robust digital highway, its physical retail vehicles are in need of an upgrade. The market is trending heavily towards Retail Media, Mobile Video, and Kazakh-Language Content, driven by a hyper-connected population. Conversely, traditional Search, Print, and Human-Centric BTL are in decline, victims of AI automation and labor market shifts.

The comparison with China highlights a clear roadmap for the next phase of growth: the adoption of "Phygital" infrastructure. By importing Chinese production technologies like transparent displays and smart mirrors, and adopting the "Community Hub" philosophy of retail, Kazakhstan can bridge the gap, transforming its promotion market from a transactional exchange into an experiential ecosystem. The brands that win in 2025 will be those that stop looking for promoters to hand out flyers and start building automated, content-rich environments that speak the local language—both digitally and culturally.
