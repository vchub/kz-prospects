# Strategic Analysis of the Advertising Ecosystem in the Republic of Kazakhstan (2025–2026)

## Market Dynamics, Comparative Gaps, and Prospective Ventures

### Executive Summary

The advertising market of the Republic of Kazakhstan has entered a definitive phase of maturation and structural transformation as of early 2025. No longer merely a satellite market of the post-Soviet space, Kazakhstan has developed a unique digital ecosystem characterized by the "Super App" hegemony of **Kaspi.kz**, a rapidly digitizing consumer base with **92.9% internet penetration**, and a burgeoning, albeit fragmented, AdTech landscape.

Current market analysis indicates a robust expansion trajectory, with the total advertising market growing by **17% in the first half of 2025 to reach 27 billion KZT**, driven predominantly by a **29% surge in digital advertising revenues**. However, this growth masks significant structural asymmetries. The market is bifurcated between a highly advanced fintech-driven digital layer and a traditional media sector struggling with inventory shortages, regulatory tightening regarding the Kazakh language, and inflationary pressures.

When compared to mature markets like the United States and regional benchmarks like Russia, Kazakhstan exhibits distinct "white spaces." Specifically, the market lacks the diversified **Retail Media Network (RMN)** landscape seen in the USA and the sophisticated, automated **CPA (Cost-Per-Action)** influencer networks prevalent in Russia.

This report provides an exhaustive evaluation of these trends. It argues that the most prospective development projects lie not in replicating global models, but in adapting them to local realities:

- The creation of independent RMNs for major retailers (Magnum, Technodom) to challenge Kaspi's monopoly.
- The development of generative AI for Kazakh-language creative production.
- The industrialization of influencer performance marketing.

### 1. Macroeconomic Context and Digital Infrastructure

To understand the velocity of the advertising market, one must analyze the underlying economic and infrastructural engines driving consumer behavior.

#### 1.1 Economic Indicators and Consumer Confidence

The first four months of 2025 saw Kazakhstan's GDP grow by **6%**, a strong indicator of economic resilience. This growth was underpinned by a 7% expansion in the trade sector and a 22.4% surge in transport. For advertisers, this signals a widening middle class with increasing disposable income, though inflationary pressures remain a concern for cost-per-acquisition (CPA) metrics.

The digital economy has become the primary growth vector. The e-commerce market alone was valued at approximately **$9.92 billion in 2024**, with forecasts predicting an annualized turnover increase of 20–30% through 2025.

#### 1.2 Digital Penetration and Connectivity

Kazakhstan boasts digital infrastructure metrics that rival developed European nations.

| Metric                 | Value                 | Year-on-Year Trend | Implications for Advertisers                                        |
| :--------------------- | :-------------------- | :----------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Internet Users**     | 19.2 Million (92.9%)  | Stable saturation  | Digital reach is effectively total reach.                           |
| **Mobile Speed**       | +51.3% increase       | Significant Growth | Enables high-fidelity video ads (4K) and AR.                        |
| **Social Media Users** | 15.7 Million (75.7%)  | +11.2% Growth      | Social platforms are the de facto "television" for Gen Z.           |
| **E-commerce Share**   | 14.1% of Total Retail | Rapid Expansion    | Visibility on marketplaces is more critical than physical slotting. |

### 2. The Advertising Landscape: 2024–2025 Trends

The market is currently experiencing a "digital flip," where internet advertising expenditures are poised to permanently overtake television.

#### 2.1 Market Volume and Growth Vectors

Data from the first half of 2025 indicates a total market volume of **27 billion KZT** (+17% YoY).

- **Language-Driven Scarcity:** Legislation mandates that 50% of content (rising to 60% by 2027) must be in the Kazakh language. There is a chronic shortage of high-quality, brand-safe Kazakh-language content.
