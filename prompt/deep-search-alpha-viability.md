# Deep Search Prompt: Viability & Barriers for "Project Alpha" (Magnum Retail Media Network)

**Objective:**
Investigate why **Magnum Cash & Carry**, Kazakhstan's largest grocery retailer, has not yet launched a full-scale **Retail Media Network (RMN)** (similar to *Walmart Connect* or *Carrefour Links*). Identify the internal, technical, or market barriers preventing this transition from "Retailer" to "Media Publisher."

**Target Subject:** Magnum Cash & Carry (Kazakhstan).
**Context:** Global trend of RMNs is booming ($100B+ market), but Magnum appears to rely on basic trade marketing (catalogs/shelves).

## 1. Technical Maturity & Data Infrastructure
*   **Hypothesis:** Magnum's loyalty data exists but is "siloed" or technically unstructured, making real-time ad targeting impossible.
*   **Query Vectors:**
    *   "Magnum Cash & Carry loyalty program technology vendor"
    *   "Magnum Club app developer stack"
    *   "Magnum Go e-commerce platform backend"
    *   "Magnum Kazakhstan data analytics partners"
    *   "Retail loyalty CRM vendors Kazakhstan"
*   **Key Questions:**
    *   Who built Magnum's current app? Is it a modern stack or legacy?
    *   Do they have a Customer Data Platform (CDP) capable of segmenting users by purchase history in real-time?
    *   Is their e-commerce ("Magnum Go") integrated with their offline POS data?

## 2. Competitive & Partner Landscape
*   **Hypothesis:** They might be relying on **Kaspi** for digital sales, preventing them from building their own ad ecosystem.
*   **Query Vectors:**
    *   "Magnum partnership with Kaspi.kz details"
    *   "Magnum official store on Kaspi Marketplace"
    *   "Magnum digital strategy 2024 2025 interview"
    *   "CitrusAd competitors Kazakhstan"
    *   "Criteo retail media availability Central Asia"
*   **Key Questions:**
    *   Does Magnum sell *through* Kaspi? If so, does Kaspi own the customer data?
    *   Have global RMN vendors (CitrusAd, Criteo) entered the Kazakh market?

## 3. Organizational & Cultural Blockers
*   **Hypothesis:** Management views "Trade Marketing" as a relationship business (dinners/handshakes), not a programmatic one.
*   **Query Vectors:**
    *   "Magnum Cash & Carry marketing director interview"
    *   "Azamat Osmanov Magnum strategy digital transformation"
    *   "Magnum Kazakhstan trade marketing conditions for suppliers"
    *   "Digital transformation challenges Kazakh retail"
*   **Key Questions:**
    *   How does Magnum currently sell shelf space? (PDF catalogs vs. digital bidding).
    *   Is there a "Digital Transformation" unit within Magnum with the authority to build this?

## 4. Existing "Proto-RMN" Attempts
*   **Hypothesis:** They may have tried small pilots (e.g., digital screens) that failed or didn't scale.
*   **Query Vectors:**
    *   "Magnum in-store digital screen advertising partners"
    *   "Magnum Telegram bot advertising case studies"
    *   "Smart scales Magnum advertising mechanism"
*   **Key Questions:**
    *   Are the "Smart Scales" connected to a programmatic backend, or just a USB stick with a video loop?
    *   Who sells the ads for their current digital assets? (Internal team or agency?)

## 5. Search Instructions for the Agent
*   **Look for** LinkedIn profiles of "Product Managers" or "Data Heads" at Magnum to infer their tech focus.
*   **Prioritize** recent interviews (2024-2025) with CEO Azamat Osmanov regarding their "Ecosystem" strategy.
*   **Check** supplier trade portals for Magnum to see if "Digital Ads" are a listed line item.
