# Deep Search Prompt: Viability & Barriers for "Project Gamma" (CPA Influencer Exchange in Kazakhstan)

**Objective:**
Investigate why a large-scale "Cost-Per-Action" (CPA) influencer platform (similar to Russia's *Perfluence* or global *LTK/RewardStyle*) has not yet achieved dominance in Kazakhstan. Identify structural, technical, or cultural blockers that have prevented this model from scaling.

**Target Region:** Kazakhstan (Primary), Central Asia (Secondary).
**Context:** The market has high social media usage but relies on manual "flat-fee" influencer payments.

## 1. Competitive Landscape & Failed Attempts
*   **Query Vectors:**
    *   "CPA influencer marketing platforms Kazakhstan"
    *   "Perfluence Kazakhstan market entry status"
    *   "Admitad Kazakhstan influencer case studies"
    *   "Performance marketing agencies Almaty influencer database"
    *   "Why did [Failed Startup Name] fail in Kazakhstan marketing?"
*   **Key Questions:**
    *   Are Russian giants like **Perfluence** or **GetBlogger** already active? If so, what is their market penetration?
    *   Are there local startups (e.g., from Astana Hub) that tried this and pivoted?
    *   Do agencies like **JKS Entertainment** already offer a "performance" product, or is it strictly retainer-based?

## 2. The "Technical Wall" (Attribution & Integration)
*   **Hypothesis:** The model requires retailers to integrate tracking pixels or accept external promo codes. **Kaspi.kz** (80% of market) is a Walled Garden.
*   **Query Vectors:**
    *   "Kaspi.kz affiliate program for third parties"
    *   "Kaspi marketing external traffic attribution API"
    *   "Wildberries Kazakhstan affiliate program conditions"
    *   "Flip.kz affiliate marketing for bloggers"
    *   "Technodom referral program API documentation"
*   **Key Questions:**
    *   Does Kaspi allow external promo codes (from influencers) to trigger discounts?
    *   Can a third-party platform technically track a sale on Kaspi/Wildberries/Ozon?
    *   If the "Big 3" marketplaces block external tracking, is the remaining market (independent e-com) large enough to sustain this business?

## 3. Financial & Legal Infrastructure (The "Blogger Tax")
*   **Hypothesis:** Mass payouts to thousands of micro-influencers are legally complex due to new tax laws.
*   **Query Vectors:**
    *   "Kazakhstan online platform law tax implications for micro-influencers"
    *   "Automated payouts to self-employed Kazakhstan API"
    *   "Tax agents for bloggers Kazakhstan legislation 2025"
    *   "Mass payout platforms Kazakhstan (e.g., Wooppay, Qiwi) for gig workers"
*   **Key Questions:**
    *   Can a platform automatically deduct the "blogger tax" on behalf of the user?
    *   Is the administrative burden of onboarding 5,000 influencers compliant with the "Online Platform" law?

## 4. Cultural Maturity (CPA vs. Flat Fee)
*   **Hypothesis:** Kazakh influencers prefer safe flat fees over risky commission-based models.
*   **Query Vectors:**
    *   "Kazakhstan influencer earnings report 2024 2025"
    *   "Micro-influencer monetization rates Instagram TikTok Kazakhstan"
    *   "Challenges of influencer marketing in Central Asia interviews"
    *   "Brand versus performance marketing Kazakhstan trends"
*   **Key Questions:**
    *   Is there a "trust gap" where influencers fear brands won't report sales honestly?
    *   Are micro-influencers (5k-50k followers) desperate enough for revenue to accept CPA deals?

## 5. Search Instructions for the Agent
*   **Prioritize** interviews with local CMOs (Magnum, Technodom, Bank managers) discussing marketing challenges.
*   **Look for** "Post-Mortem" articles of Kazakh AdTech startups.
*   **Check** the "Partners" pages of major Kazakh retailers to see if they list any affiliate networks.
