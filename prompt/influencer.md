project:

7.1 Project Alpha: The "Magnum" Retail Media Network
Concept: Transforming Magnum Cash & Carry (the largest grocery retailer) into a digital media publisher.
Rationale: Magnum possesses high-frequency transaction data that Kaspi lacks (grocery/FMCG). Global FMCG brands (Nestle, P&G, Mars) are desperate for shopper data to target ads and measure lift.
Execution: Building a self-service ad platform where suppliers can bid for "sponsored products" in the Magnum app and digital screens in-store. This replicates the Walmart Connect model in the USA.5
Why it wins: It creates a new high-margin revenue stream for the retailer and gives brands an alternative to the Kaspi/Google duopoly.
