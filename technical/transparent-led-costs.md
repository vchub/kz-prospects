# Cost Analysis: Transparent LED & Holographic Display Systems

**Market Context:** 2024-2025 Pricing (FOB China / Central Asia Import)

## 1. Hardware Pricing by Technology Class

Prices are estimated per square meter (m²) based on Pixel Pitch (Resolution) and Brand Tier.

| Technology Class                  | Product Example   | Transparency      | Est. Cost (FOB China)    | Best For                                  |
| :-------------------------------- | :---------------- | :---------------- | :----------------------- | :---------------------------------------- |
| **Holographic Film / Integrated** | **MUXWAVE M3/M6** | **High (90-95%)** | **$2,500 - $4,500 / m²** | "Phantom" mannequins, luxury storefronts. |
| **Transparent Mesh / Cabinet**    | **Leyard Vteam**  | **Med (70-80%)**  | **$800 - $1,800 / m²**   | Large mall facades, atrium balustrades.   |
| **Generic Adhesive Film**         | _Non-Branded_     | High (85%)        | **$600 - $1,200 / m²**   | Budget entry-level; lower brightness.     |

## 2. Project Cost Simulation (Total Cost of Ownership)

**Scenario:** A standard shop window installation of **7.5 m²** (3m W x 2.5m H).

### Model A: High-End "Holographic" (MUXWAVE P3.91)

_Focused on maximum invisibility and 3D "floating" effect._

- **Hardware (7.5 m² @ $3,500):** $26,250
- **Control System (NovaStar H-Series/High-End):** $1,500
- **Install & Commissioning (Lamination/Wiring):** $3,000
- **Initial 3D Content Pack (Custom Anamorphic):** $5,000
- **Estimated Total Project:** **~$35,750**

### Model B: Performance "Transparent Mesh" (Leyard P3.9/7.8)

_Focused on branding and visibility with moderate transparency._

- **Hardware (7.5 m² @ $1,200):** $9,000
- **Control System (Taurus Player/Standard):** $600
- **Installation (Hanging/Rigging):** $1,500
- **Total Project:** **~$11,100**

## 3. Key Cost Variables

- **Pixel Pitch (P):** **P3.9** (High Resolution) costs ~2x more than **P10** (Low Resolution) due to 4x LED density.
- **Brightness (Nits):**
  - _Direct Sunlight (Window):_ Requires >4,500 nits.
  - _Indoor Only (Mall Atrium):_ 1,000–1,500 nits is sufficient and 30% cheaper.
- **Logistics & Duties (Kazakhstan Context):**
  - **VAT:** 12%
  - **Customs Duty:** ~0-10% (depending on EAEU classification).
  - **Shipping:** LEDs are "Fragile/Electronic." Crating and air-freight from Shenzhen to Almaty/Astana adds significant overhead compared to rail.

## 4. Maintenance & Operational Costs

- **Power Consumption:** Avg. 300W–500W per m² during peak brightness.
- **Module Replacement:** Unlike standard screens, repairing a "film" screen (Muxwave) often requires replacing the entire laminated section if a chip fails, whereas "mesh" (Leyard) allows for bar-level replacement.
